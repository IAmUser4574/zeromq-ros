ZeroMQ-ROS
========

ZeroMQ-ROS is a middleware that allows for the control of multiple ROS masters from
a single coordinator and makes it easy to create swarm applications using the standard
ROS framework. ZeroMQ-ROS uses the ZeroMQ message queue to communicate between the coordinator
and the agents.
