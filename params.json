{"name":"ZeroMQ-ROS Middlware","tagline":"ROS Wrapper Using ZeroMQ","body":"ZeroMQ-ROS\r\n========\r\n\r\nZeroMQ-ROS is a middleware that allows for the control of multiple ROS masters from\r\na single coordinator and makes it easy to create swarm applications using the standard\r\nROS framework. ZeroMQ-ROS uses the ZeroMQ message queue to communicate between the coordinator\r\nand the agents.\r\n\r\n## Architecture\r\n### Agents\r\n\r\nAgents are members of the swarm that will be controlled by a coordinator. They are referenced by\r\na unique identifying name and listen for JSON serialized ROS messages on a message queue. These\r\nserialized messages are then constructed into ROS messages and published to the associated topic.\r\n\r\n### Coordinators\r\n\r\nCoordinators are the controllers of the swarm. They can send JSON serialized ROS messages to agents\r\nthat get published to the associated topic on the agent's ROS master. To enable bi-directional,\r\ncoordinators can also be agents and listen for messages.\r\n\r\n### Naming service\r\n\r\nThe naming service is used to associate a robot's unique name to a host and port of the ZeroMQ\r\nmessage queue. This is vital for having dynamic swarm membership because instead of manually sharing\r\na configuration file, a persistent, centralized server runs that holds all of this information. Also,\r\nthe naming service holds a record of what agents are currently *alive* and able to be used.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n**[Warning] You must already have ROS installed on all machines you would like\r\nto have in your swarm**\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/wallarelvo/zeromq-ros.git\r\n    $ make\r\n    \r\n### Other distributions\r\n1. Install Ubuntu\r\n2. Follow instructions for installation on Ubuntu\r\n    \r\n## Setting up the middleware\r\n### Environment Variables\r\n\r\nIn order to use ZeroMQ-ROS, you must set a few environmental variables. These can\r\nbe set by exporting environmental variables in the terminal every time you start a\r\nnew terminal, or you can be sane and add them to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.\r\nYou must set variables described below. These environment variables need to be set on\r\nevery computer running ZeroMQ-ROS.\r\n\r\n- `ZMQROS_NS_HOST` -- Host of the naming service\r\n- `ZMQROS_NS_PORT` -- Port of the naming service\r\n- `ZMQROS_ROBOT_ID` -- A unique identifying name of the robot running ZeroMQ-ROS\r\n- `ZMQROS_ROOT` -- The location of the root directory of the ZeroMQ-ROS installation\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nWherever you choose to run the name server, you must also be running a RethinkDB database.\r\nThis database stores the names and identification numbers of the agents you wish the name\r\nserver to supervise. For instance, if you work in a robotics lab, the database\r\nwill contain all of the names of the robots in your lab along with some identification number.\r\nAll of the names in the database do not need to be used at the same time, they are just there\r\nfor reference by the name server.\r\nThese names need to be known a priori for more efficient swarm creation and name allocation.\r\nTo do this run\r\n\r\n    $ rethinkdb --bind all\r\n\r\nThis will run the RethinkDB instance. In order to populate the database, run Zui, the\r\nZeroMQ-ROS UI running,\r\n\r\n    $ zmqros --ui\r\n    \r\nThen to populate the database visit, `localhost:9000/add`. The website will ask you for the\r\nrobot names and an identification number. This is useful so that you can link the robot\r\nto IP addresses, Vicon identification and so on.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\n1. First run the name server and populate the database with robot information. This step does \r\nnot need to occur every time you run the swarm, however, the name server needs to be running for\r\nagents and coordinators to communicate. The agents and the coordinators need to have their\r\nenvironment variables pointing to the address and port the name server will be running from.\r\n    - `$ zmqros --ns`\r\n2. On all of the agents in the swarm that are specified in the name server, run the agent code. \r\nThis step also does not need to occur everytime the swarm is to be controlled, however to control an agent,\r\nthe agent program must be running.\r\n    - `$ zmqros --agent`\r\n3. Run the coordinator code from where ever the coordinator is located.\r\n4. (Optional) Now you are able to control the swarm. To look at properties in the swarm, run Zui, the web app for the\r\nmiddleware. Using Zui, you will be able to look at the members of the swarm that are currently alive and\r\nsend ROS messages to them through a GUI.\r\n    - `$ zmqros --ui`\r\n    \r\n\r\n## Coordinator example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport zmqros\r\nfrom zmqros.coordinator import open_swarm\r\nimport random\r\nimport time\r\nfrom geometry_msgs.msg import Twist\r\n\r\nns_host = zmqros.get_ns_host()\r\nns_port = zmqros.get_ns_port()\r\nnserver = zmqros.coordinator.NameServer(ns_host, ns_port)\r\nnames = nserver.get_names()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef run():\r\n    with open_swarm(ns_host, ns_port, names) as swarm:\r\n        while True:\r\n            for bot in swarm.get_bots():\r\n                t = Twist()\r\n                t.linear.x = random.random()\r\n                t.linear.y = random.random()\r\n                t.linear.z = random.random()\r\n                t.angular.x = random.random()\r\n                t.angular.y = random.random()\r\n                t.angular.z = random.random()\r\n\r\n                bot.send_message(\"geometry_msgs/Twist\", \"/cmd_vel\", t)\r\n\r\n            time.sleep(0.1)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    run()\r\n\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
